Fully experimental project focused on usage of deep learning in computer vision. Basic goal is to provide on-line image processing (and particularly way to coloring gray-scale image based on provided colorful pattern). Project is available on-line on:
```sh
http://ec2-54-93-59-56.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5000/
```
Core technologies: React, Node.js (with Express), socketIO, Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow. During adjusting neural network temporary solution based on k-means clustering is provided.
